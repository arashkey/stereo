function rms = RMS( imgL,imgR )

% rms computes the root-mean-square (RMS) of values supplied as a
% vector, matrix, or list of discrete values (scalars).  If the input is
% a matrix, rms returns a row vector containing the RMS of each column.

% David Feldman proposed the following simpler function definition:
%
%    RMS = sqrt(mean([varargin{:}].^2))
%
% With this definition, the function accepts ([1,2],[3,4]) as input,
% producing 2.7386 (this is the same result that one would get with
% input of (1,2,3,4).  I'm not sure how the function should behave for
% input of ([1,2],[3,4]).  Probably it should produce the vector
% [rms(1,3) rms(2,4)].  For the moment, however, my code simply produces
% an error message when the input is a list that contains one or more
% non-scalars.

rms= mean(sqrt (mean (imgL .^2) ));
